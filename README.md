# Project Derdio
Mission Space Lab is challenge for students and young people the chance to have their scientific experiments run on the ISS. Mote on https://astro-pi.org/missions/space-lab/

Measurement of the parameters of a surrounding atmosphere in an interior under influence of cosmic radiation and on the earth surface.

Measurement of the atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and calculation of density of an interior air on the ground.
Conditions: day light, no artificial illumination.
        Test period: 150 minutes
         Recording interval: every 10 minutes

Measurement of the atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and calculation of density of an interior air on the ground.
Conditions:  artificial illumination.
        Test period: 150 minutes
        Recording interval: every 10 minutes

Measurement of the atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and calculation of density of an interior air on the ground.
Conditions: full darkness, no day light, no artificial illumination.
        Test period: 150 minutes
        Recording interval: every 10 minutes

Measurement of the pressure, temperature, humidity and calculation of density of an interior air on the ISS (under influence of cosmic radiation and 0 gravity force)
Conditions: day light, or an artificial illumination.
        Test period: 150 minutes
        Recording interval: every 10 minutes


Test objective: We would like to measure and compare the atmospheric air parameters on the earth surface with those measured in the space. We would like to discover how different is density of the interior air in the ISS compare to an interior air density in a common room office or a classroom on the ground.
